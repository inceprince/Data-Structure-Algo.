# 🧠 My DSA in Java Journey 🚀

Hey there! 🙋‍♂️  
Welcome to my little algorithmic lab. This repository is a **digital journal** of my journey into the world of **Data Structures and Algorithms using Java** — where I learn, practice, struggle, and grow every single day. 🧩💻

---

## 📚 What's Inside?

## 📌 Prerequisites

Before diving into DSA, I brushed up on core Java concepts. This section contains:

* 🧠 Java syntax essentials
* 🚀 OOP concepts (Inheritance, Polymorphism, etc.)
* 🧰 Useful built-in classes like `ArrayList`, `HashMap`, `Collections`, etc.
* 🧪 Practice problems to build Java confidence


This repo is my **DSA playground** — filled with:

* 🧪 **Solved problems** from platforms like LeetCode, GFG, HackerRank, etc.
* 📂 **Topic-wise folders** — Arrays, Strings, LinkedLists, Trees, and more!
* 💡 **Pattern-based approaches** to common coding interview questions
* 📓 **My notes, observations & aha! moments** during problem solving

Think of it as my **algorithm vault + practice log + preparation toolkit**. 😊

## 🚧 Constantly Evolving...

I'm currently in the grind phase — solving problems daily, learning new patterns, and slowly building my confidence one question at a time.

I’ll keep updating this repo as I go — so feel free to explore, revisit, and grow along with me! 🔄💥

## 🎯 My Goals

- Crack coding rounds in TCS NQT, Infosys, and top MNCs 💼
- Build solid logic-building skills 🧠
- Understand DSA concepts deeply with Java 🔍
- Practice 300+ quality problems 🏋️‍♂️
